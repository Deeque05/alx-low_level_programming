0x08-recursion 
Imagine you have a set of nesting dolls. Each doll has a smaller doll inside of it. Recursion in C is like opening the dolls one by one, starting from the biggest doll, until you reach the smallest one.

In programming, recursion means calling a function inside of itself. So, just like opening the nesting dolls, the function keeps calling itself, passing in smaller and smaller values until it reaches a base case, which is like the smallest doll.

Once the function reaches the base case, it stops calling itself and starts returning values back up the chain of calls, just like putting the dolls back inside of each other.

This process of calling the function inside of itself continues until the outermost call is completed, and you get your final result.
